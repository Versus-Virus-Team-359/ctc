## About

**Coronavirus Treatment Comparison (CTC)** was made during the 48 hours long #VersusVirus online hackathon, held under the patronage of the Swiss government. Our team (#359), initially composed of 9 members, at the end containing 2 people decided to solve a challenge #100 ("Light up the effective treatments"). We built a web application using React and Next.js, which includes general stats related to coronavirus, as well as treatment comparisons. Despite having a limited human force, we managed to finish everything and submit the project.
